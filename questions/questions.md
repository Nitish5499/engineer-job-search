Another way is to get your certs included into the browser’s prelist.

- Heap based buffer overflows. I’d like to research mitigations that are backward-compatible with the C standard and that don’t require changes to an existing code base. Similar to canaries on the stack. I’d choose that, because this vuln class is frequently exploited and C is not going away any time soon although it’s so old.

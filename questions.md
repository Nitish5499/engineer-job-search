I also read about the company's revenue and growth metrics and other business's commentaries on the work they do here. I made sure this was a place I would belong and wanted to belong. I also, since I work in information security, researched their outlook and buy-in to security to see if my job is an important asset to the company or if I'd be fighting an uphill battle everyday to prove the worth fo the work I do. Security is obviously a top priority for everyone as Zoom, so it was a match made in infosec heaven.

<details><summary>What is a Server Side Request Forgery attack?</summary>
<p>

- A vulnerability in a web server that exists due to a lack of malicious user input detection, sanitation, and validation checks. SSRF vulnerabilities don't validate the user provided URL endpoints before processing/calling the URL endpoints. This allows a bad-actor to make requests to bogon IP addresses (127.0.0.1, 169.254.0.0/16, fe80::1, etc) which often can force the web server to reveal sensitive data and website administration pages that only run on localhost to a bad-actor on the public internet.

<details><summary>How does HTTPS work? How is TLS and Diffie Helman used, and what steps are involved in the process and what happens at each point?</summary>
<p>

- HTTPS takes the well-known and understood HTTP protocol, and simply layers a SSL/TLS (hereafter referred to simply as “SSL”) encryption layer on top of it. Servers and clients still speak exactly the same HTTP to each other, but over a secure SSL connection that encrypts and decrypts their requests and responses. The SSL layer has 2 main purposes: Verifying that you are talking directly to the server that you think you are talking to Ensuring that only the server can read what you send it and only you can read what it sends back Diffie-Hellman is used in SSL/TLS, as "ephemeral Diffie-Hellman" (the cipher suites with "DHE" in their name; see the standard). What is very rarely encountered is "static Diffie-Hellman" (cipher suites with "DH" in their name, but neither "DHE" or "DH_anon"): these cipher suites require that the server owns a certificate with a DH public key in it, which is rarely supported for a variety of historical and economical reasons, among which the main one is the availability of a free standard for RSA (PKCS#1) while the corresponding standard for Diffie-Hellman (x9.42) costs a hundred bucks, which is not much, but sufficient to deter most amateur developers. Diffie-Hellman is a key agreement protocol, meaning that if two parties (say, the SSL client and the SSL server) run this protocol, they end up with a shared secret K. However, neither client or server gets to choose the value of K; from their points of view, K looks randomly generated. It is secret (only them know K; eavesdroppers on the line do not) and shared (they both get the same value K), but not chosen. This is not encryption. A shared secret K is good enough, though, to process terabytes of data with a symmetric encryption algorithm (same K to encrypt on one side and decrypt on the other), and that is what happens in SSL. There is a well-known asymmetric encryption algorithm called RSA, though. With RSA, the sender can encrypt a message M with the recipient's public key, and the recipient can decrypt it and recover M using his private key. This time, the sender can choose the contents M. So your question might be: in a RSA world, why do we bother with AES at all ? The answer lies in the following points: There are constraints on M. If the recipient's public key has size n (in bytes, e.g. n = 256 for a 2048-bit RSA key), then the maximum size of M is n-11 bytes. In order to encrypt a longer message, we would have to split it into sufficiently small blocks, and include some reassembly mechanism. Nobody really knows how to do that securely. We have good reasons to believe that RSA on a single message is safe, but subtle weaknesses can lurk in any split-and-reassembly system and we are not comfortable with that. It is already bad enough with symmetric ciphers, where the mathematical situation is simpler. Even if we could handle the splitting-and-reassembly, there would be a size expansion. With a 2048-bit RSA key, an internal message chunk has size at most 245 bytes, but yields, when encrypted, a 256-byte sequence. This wastes our lifeforce, i.e. network bandwidth. Symmetric encryption incurs only a bounded overhead (well, SSL adds a slight overhead proportional to the data size, but it is much smaller than what would occur with a RSA-only protocol). Compared to AES, RSA is slow as Hell. We really like to have the option of using key agreement protocols like DH instead of RSA. In older times (before 2001), RSA was patented but not DH, so the US government was recommending DH. Nowadays, we want to be able to switch algorithms in case one becomes broken. In order to support key agreement protocols, we need some symmetric encryption, so we may just as well use it with RSA. It simplifies implementation and protocol analysis.

<details><summary>After the telephonic round, in onsite interview. I was asked questions on technologies I have not worked on and are not even mentioned on my resume.</summary>
<p>

- Anyway I was asked to go to Lake Forest, California for a face to face interview and was told all the expenses are covered and will be reimbursed. Flight tickets were booked by them and also the the hotel was booked by them. The interview was next day and the flight back from LA. I beard a total of $230 that included lunch, dinner and Uber travels but was never reimbursed despite being told that everything is covered. Upon returning I provided them the receipts and requested for the reimbursement on Aug 20th, 2018 (Interview was on 17th Aug). I was told that they are processing the request and I will soon receive the check in mail. Fast forward a month and after a million of emails exchange they still had the audacity to lie that my check was still under process. Eventually, I was contacted by one of the person from Accounts department asking for more information and told me that it usually takes 1-2 weeks after he approves but didn’t receive anything till date. Today marks the 2 month anniversary when I was interviewed at the cost of my own hard earned money and still no check. I have learnt a lesson that I should not just believe if it is a renowned company, the work culture will be good as well. I should have researched more and should have made an educated decision of whether or not I should work for such people. I believe it is a blessing in disguise that I was not offered the job. I guess if I have to struggle so much to get reimbursed for such a small amount ($230), how could I even imagine of getting paid. This process made my soured my interview experience and I would not recommend this company to anyone personally. If anyone still wants to go please be ready to shell out money from your own pocket as there is no guarantee you will get it back.

<details><summary>Can two different IP addresses connect to the same port on a given web server?</summary>
<p>

- This was a weird question the way he framed it (which was different from how I wrote it here on Glassdoor). I believe the answer is yes, since as long as both IP addresses are trying to connect to the same service hosted on a given port, they will be able to do so. If both IP addresses are trying to connect to two different services on the same port, they will not be able to do so.

<p>

- I was aware of the recent breach with Equifax, but was not entirely sure what caused it. I wagered a guess that it was some sort of exploit related to their web services server.
- Apache struts vulnerability was exploited. Struts REST supports XML using a programming library called XStream, which allows you to encode any sort of Java object into XML. XStream XML data can be manipulated by injecting the XML representation of Java objects into the request. An attacker would then take advantage of this to execute arbitrary code or shell commands in the context of the server running the XStream process.

An encrypted message which is encrypted with a public key, can only be decrypted with each users private key which is kept hidden. The problem with this initial key exchange is that before the two parties exchange keys, they cannot communicate securely. This introduces the problem of a Man-In-The-Middle attack. Hashing is irreversible where as encryption is reversible. MD5 and SHA-1 are fairly common hashing types but are no longer considered secure. SHA-256 is considered much stronger. A salt which appends a random value to a password before it is hashed can be used to prevent having the same hashes in a database if two users happen to use the same password. This makes it more difficult to carry out dictionary or rainbow table attacks. Encoding converts data to a common form to be transferred over a medium in order to protect the integrity of the data.

<details><summary>Brain teaser asking how to send a box with a diamond it in all the way across the country if the send and receiver have different keys.</summary>
<p>

- Assuming you have two locks and only the key for one while the person across the country has the other, you could lock the diamond with the lock for which you have the key. Then enclose that box in another container which you lock for which you don't have the key (which the individual at the destination holds). When the box arrives at the destination, the individual with the key can unlock the first box, find the key for the enclosed box, open it and have the diamond. Shortcomings here are that you lose your key and are then incapable of using this system again for the next transfer unless you keep copies or the key is returned by the receiver.

- Compress first, then encrypt, or you'll end up with a file larger than you started with. Then talked about how compression algorithms / encryption inherently work. He wasn't listening to my answer, so I guess it didn't matter.
- Encrypt before compression, if you are forced to pick one or the other. Compressing after encryption is virtually pointless for data size but compressing before encryption leads to compression oracle attacks like seen in CRIME and BREACH.

This gives you a better chance at getting the job because they can relay what you said easier to the hiring manager (if it isn't them themselves).

- Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in Web applications. XSS enables attackers to inject client-side script into Web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same origin policy. - SQL injection is a code injection technique, used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g. to dump the database contents to the attacker).

He showed me a bad photocopy of the company's core values... status quo. I said, Yes! I agree. He asked me, "The client is always right. True or false?" I said, "Well, the short answer is 'yes, of course! But for the past decades there's a much larger understanding of customer relationships... and it involves developing a partnership and strong supply chain" . They never called me to inform me of the interview result. I reached out the the company director who never took or returned my calls. No wonder that outfit had a non-stop search for production supervisors and process engineers. The company will be gone in a few years.

<details><summary>During the technical interview, the second interview asked, "How would you configure trace route in a cisco firewall for a group of windows users?" I repeated the question to make sure I heard it correctly, and he responded with, "Windows fundamentally handles trace route differently than Unix does."</summary>
<p>

- The answer to the question is obviously, You configure ICMP through the cisco appropriate syntax for the windows users. I was thrown off by him saying what he did about Unix and was not even given a chance to actually answer the initial question. so my question is, If you wanted to know the answer to the first question, why would you even ask the second one basically replacing the first question? How is anyone supposed to know which to answer or what the person asking the question is actually looking for?
- The problem is that your answer of "You configure ICMP through the Cisco appropriate syntax for the windows users" is incorrect. (Or, at best, incredibly vague.) It's definitely a fair question. While Windows uses ICMP for traceroute, it's important to note that Linux technically uses UDP. Therefore, the responses they get from the devices along the path is different, depending on which source device you used to initiate the trace. As such, the required configuration is equally different on the Cisco device. For Windows, you'd need an inbound rule allowing icmp time-exceeded. For Linux, you'd need an inbound rule allowing icmp unreachable. For both, you'd also need to add an "inspect icmp" statement. Looking at his question as well as his explanation after you repeated it, it's safe to say that there was nothing wrong with the way he asked it. The problem is that you didn't know the answer. In fairness though, it IS a trick question that gets asked of all of us, even myself when I applied.
- Here is my problem with the question. I know that linux/unix/solaris/AIX all utilize UDP. some of the more modern and updated unix based operating systems do utilize icmp instead of UDP. My issue is not with the fact that he asked this. Yes I did get quite flustered and it threw me off, but had he simply stated how would you configure a cisco firewall for a specific group of windows users, I would have quickly and easily stated that you would create the appropriate network object group containing the subnet(s)/IP(s) of the users and allow icmp time-exceeded. I could have easily sat down in front of a cisco ASA or PIX and had it implemented and working, I would say, easily in less than 15 mins. That would also be dependent on the subtnet(s)/IP(s) that needed to be added after creating the network object group. So yes it is a trick question, and was very confused as it seemed he wanted to know how to configure it for linux/unix, not windows even though that is what he asked. I have worked with numerous network devices from numerous vendors and so the exact syntax for each one sometimes escapes me, but I am more than technically competent enough to find the syntax and implement it with no help. I guess the most insulting part of the interview process is that based off of this interview, the recruiter stated, "You are just average, and we need someone that is exceptional. so we can't proceed with your submission." That is a direct quote. I have made it further in my career with no degree, minimal college education and through my blood, sweet and tears, metaphorically, in less time than most hope to with a bachelors degree. I work with SMEs and collegues with 15+ years experience as their equal. That is not "Just average." I have written SLAs, OLAs, technical manuals, disaster recovery plans, training plans, training material, and numerous other things for the DoD, TSA, Banks, and municipalities. I have been working on global networks for over 5 years as well. I have solved problems that engineers with at least twice as much experience as myself, that they were unable to solve. I have run into issues that have stumped Microsoft themselves for over two weeks. If this is the career of an "Average" engineer, then by all means, I am just average.
- It's unfortunate that the way you were dismissed was a little bit unprofessional and seemingly misinformed. Also, in fairness, it's probably never a good idea to tell a candidate that they're "just average", even in cases where they really are. For what it's worth, I'd like to apologize on behalf of DD (as much as I'm technically allowed to do so) for the way it was handled. However, regarding the original point, the interview itself is specifically designed to fluster you. We actually expect most people to get this particular question wrong. The idea is not for us to see if you know it all but more specifically how you deal with questions you don't know the answer to. (Bonus points if you DO know, obviously.) We certainly don't expect candidates to know everything offhand, we just like to see whether or not you're going to try to BS your way through an answer. Since I wasn't on this particular call, I have no idea how it went for you but I can guarantee that the decision wasn't based on this question alone but was more likely an overall view of your skills based on all of your answers. I do realize that it's no picnic when you're on the phone but for the most part, they do try to take that into consideration. (I was hired over the phone as well, all the way from South Africa.)
- I do understand what you have said, and I greatly appreciate the apology. I was very excited about this opportunity. I believe based off my experience and my knowledge of the position that I would have been a great asset to the team. I honestly do not know why the engineers I interviewed with or the recruiter would have felt the way the recruiter did. I know that the engineers I spoke with told me that the recruiter would call me with the next steps and I answered every question that they asked, except the afore mentioned question. The following link is my linkedin profile (http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=10589063&amp;trk=tab_pro). This is about all I can say. I was excited and looking forward to the opportunity, but obviously I was not considered. Thank you for your time, response, and consideration. I wish you the best.
- In window you use tracert which works with icmp echo and reply message and in cisco environment you use traceroute command undp as well as icmp. But you have to configure for firewall to allow icmp replies

<details><summary>Describe SSL in detail.</summary>
<p>

- 1. SSL Handshake: Symmetric Encryption a. Client Hello b. Server Hello c. Server sends its certificate and requests certificate from client. Server also sends its asymmetric public key d. If certificate was requested by client, client sends it to the server. f. Client Key Exchange Message: Client protocol version (prevents rollback attacks), Pre-master secret which is encrypted using server's asymmetric public key. Pre-master secret is 48-byte client-generated number. g. Server receives the Pre-Master Secret. Server and client compute the master secret locally and derive the session keys from it. h. Client sends "Change cipher spec" notification to server to indicate that the client will start using new session keys for hashing and encrypting messages. Client also sends "Client Finished" message. i. Server receives "Change cipher spec" notification from client and switches its record layer security state to symmetric encryption using the session keys. Server sends "Server Finished" message to the client. 2. SSL Certificate: Asymmetric Encryption More detail goes into this answer. But the above answer is a sign that you know something.

<details><summary>puzzle: if there are 72 legs in total and there are 28 animals involving chickens and horses , how many are horses and how many chickens, solve without using equations? How does a vending machine work, describe blocks and what are funtions just to see if I can break down problem into small modules and analyse</summary>
<p>

- There are 8 horses and 20 chickens. My method was immediately assume we have 14 chickens and horses. This equates to 84 legs, and we want 72 legs, so we need to subtract 12 legs from them, so if we remove 6 horses, and add 6 chickens, we will lose 12 legs, and end up with (14-6) == 8 horses + (14+6) == 20 chickens. Of course, I would rather solve with a set of linear equations: h+c == 28 and 4h+2c == 72, solve for h or c in the first equation, plug that equation in to the second, and solve.

<details><summary>how to make an OS real time ? name few RTOSs how to make memcopy fast? code was written over board and had to identify problems in it like memory leak , accessing memory location which is not allocated</summary>
<p>

- I would say that you would make more use of high-resolution timers, and minimize the number of tasks for the embedded system. For memcpy, I would just have a loop that immediately stores the bytes in the src in the dest. Memory leaks are ez4ence to find, just make sure you are freeing memory when you are done using it.

<details><summary>what is volatile, static ? how would it affect if the static keyword used for big array inside a function? what are sections of memory and what kind of variable is stored where?</summary>
<p>

- if Volatile used then the compiler dont consider to optimize that variable . Assume that a variable changed at the time of running . But some compiler optimized .to avoid that we use volatile. Static is the keyword which is used to initialized to once that means extra burden for a compiler to keep the variable .and permanantly allocate space in stack.if you diclare static array then stack overflow will occur.
- Just clarify one thing, the static variables within a function are not allocated to the function or thread's stack, instead, they are allocated to BSS area, just like other global variables. so it won't affect their function too much.
- static variable is not stored on stack.

<details><summary>Encryption modes, CTR, ECB, CBC.., How HMAC works, why HMAC is designed in that way</summary>
<p>

- In cryptography, a keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) is a specific type of message authentication code (MAC) involving a cryptographic hash function and a secret cryptographic key.
- Hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) provides the server and the client each with a private key that is known only to that specific server and that specific client. The client creates a unique HMAC, or hash, per request to the server by hashing the request data with the private keys and sending it as part of a request. What makes HMAC more secure than Message Authentication Code (MAC) is that the key and the message are hashed in separate steps.

<details><summary>How many bits do you need for a subnet size.</summary>
<p>

- Need to know subnetting off top of your head.
- If number of addreses required in a subnet is "N" , then you need 2 more (network and bcst addreses) in addition to "N". So "N+2" is rounded of to Next 2 to the power . For e.g if we need 64 addresses in a subnet then , 66 rounded to next 2 to the power is is 2**7 ie 128. so number of bits required is 7.
- The minimum addresses needed is 2 bits for 4 addresses 2^(# of addresses) = 2^2 which used for pint to point links. Max addresses can go as much as class A IP address /8 so for maximum bits is 32-8 = 24 bit

<details><summary>Write a function that can determine if an input number is a power of 2.</summary>
<p>

- Multiple answers. Powers of 2 only have a single 1's bit, rest will be 0's. Use that fact. X (LOGICAL AND) (X - 1) = 0 i.f.f. is a power of 2.
- Indeed, it is as the previous poster stated. Quite simple -- my initial thought would have been repeated division by 2 looking for a remainder, but that is much heavier lifting. int is_power_of_2 (int val) { if (!(val &amp; val -1)) { return 1; // val is a power of 2 } else { return 0; } }
- Sure, but every number is a power of 2, or a sum of powers of 2. For example, 16 is (2^4), and 33 is (2^5 + 2^0). If we want to just see if it is divisible, like Brian mentions, well, modulus operator works fine, but I don't think that is entirely the jist of the question. (X % 2) = 0 =&gt; divisible by 2, but not necessarily a power of 2, but in stead a sum of powers of 2.
- I like the idea of the `val &amp; (val - 1)`, but it only works for positive integer powers of two. The internal representation of floats ( 2 ^ -3, for example) does not give you a sensible answer when using bitwise and. What you might note is that `log_2(n)` will be an integer if n is a power of 2. In python you can just do this: ```import math def is_power_of_2(n:int) -&gt; bool: return math.log2(n).is_integer()``` Also, even if we're limiting values to nonnegative powers of 2, the log_2 method is fast: ```import math val = 2**4096 - 1 def is_power_of_2_log(n:int) -&gt; bool: return math.log2(val).is_integer() def is_power_of_2_and(n:int) -&gt; bool: return val &amp; (val - 1) == 0 %%timeit is_power_of_2_log(val) # 468 ns ± 32.1 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each) %%timeit is_power_of_2_and(val) # 766 ns ± 12.6 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)```
